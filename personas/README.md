## Mark
- 22 year old student in Santa Cruz, California
- Studying for a Masters in Psychology

Mark is a hard working student who spends the majority of his time studying. In his free time, Mark is often seen working out and skateboarding at his local skatepark.

Mark often listens to music during his day, as he is able to have his headphones in while studying, lifting, and skating. But he finds it very tedious trying to discover new music. He is a very busy person, and doesn’t have time to constantly sit around and listen to a lot of songs so he can  decide what to add to his playlist. Because of this, he has been listening to a lot of the same music lately. It has been making music very bland to him, to the point where he doesn’t even like putting his headphones on anymore. He wishes there was a way to quickly hear songs that could give him new music interests when he has little breaks, like before he goes to bed.

## John
- 18 year old in North Dakota 
- Only listens to the same 3 country/rock albums
- Enjoys most of his days playing video games or doing mundane tasks

John keeps himself preoccupied throughout the day doing menial tasks. When people ask him what music he listens to he usually defaults to “I don't really listen to music”. His music knowledge is not broad so he wishes he can discover new music in the easiest way possible. Without having to front to back multiple songs and or libraries of music.

# Scenarios

  Scenario 1 - After a long day Mark wants to wind down by listening to music, but doesn't want to listen to their usual run of music. They want to find a way to easily discover and explore new music. Without scrolling through endless libraries of music. He doesn’t want to spend too much time on it.

  Scenario 2 - Emily is tasked with creating a playlist for a background setting. But have no music or their current music taste wouldn’t deem appropriate. Their deadline is the following work week and they have no idea what “comforting” music could consist of. They want a quick way to get a list of songs that are calming for her clients without having to listen to five minute plus songs.
