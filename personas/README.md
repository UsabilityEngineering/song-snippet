Mark
22 year old student in Santa Cruz, California
Studying for a Masters in Psychology

Mark is a hard working student who spends the majority of his time studying. In his free time, Mark is often seen working out and skateboarding at his local skatepark.

Mark often listens to music during his day, as he is able to have his headphones in while studying, lifting, and skating. But he finds it very tedious trying to discover new music. He is a very busy person, and doesn’t have time to constantly sit around and listen to a lot of songs so he can  decide what to add to his playlist. Because of this, he has been listening to a lot of the same music lately. It has been making music very bland to him, to the point where he doesn’t even like putting his headphones on anymore. He wishes there was a way to quickly hear songs that could give him new music interests when he has little breaks, like before he goes to bed.
