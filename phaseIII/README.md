# Methods -

In order to fully understand how well our prototype will do in front of actual users, we had 5 participants fully test our prototype and compare it to our fellow competitor Shazam. By having the users perform various tasks, it allowed us to evaluate our prototype and see where we currently stand in terms of releasing the actual product. Through our testing we were able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of our prototype and how we compare to actual products on the market. 

We had participants run through our own prototype and run through the various tasks that we have listed out down below. After the users completed the tasks for the prototype, we had them run the same task again, but on the Shazam app. We picked these tasks in order to fully test out our prototype and highlight the appeal. We had the users apply the “think-aloud protocol” in order to fully understand their thought process and identify areas that may need improvement. To begin our user test, we asked each participant some questions in the beginning to get a better understanding of users' music discovery.

# Findings - 
Task 1: All participants were able to create an account and sign-in, letting us know that our sign-up process is simple as well as intuitive.
The ability to already be logged in after creating an account made the experince much more enjoyable for participants. One user voiced that they liked that there was minimal information needed to create an account.
