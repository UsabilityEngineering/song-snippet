# Methods -

In order to fully understand how well our prototype will do in front of actual users, we had 5 participants fully test our prototype and compare it to our fellow competitor Shazam. By having the users perform various tasks, it allowed us to evaluate our prototype and see where we currently stand in terms of releasing the actual product. Through our testing we were able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of our prototype and how we compare to actual products on the market. 

We had participants run through our own prototype and run through the various tasks that we have listed out down below. After the users completed the tasks for the prototype, we had them run the same task again, but on the Shazam app. We picked these tasks in order to fully test out our prototype and highlight the appeal. We had the users apply the “think-aloud protocol” in order to fully understand their thought process and identify areas that may need improvement. To begin our user test, we asked each participant some questions in the beginning to get a better understanding of users' music discovery. 

* Background: 
    * How did you go along discovering new music you like?
    * Following along with music discovery, would you say you are satisfied with your current method of music discovery? If not, what are some ways it can be improved upon
    * Were there any specific features that made you able to find new music. 

* Task 1: 
    * First, we would like you to imagine you are a new user trying this application for the first time. You are looking to try out this new app to find new songs that you may not have heard before. Walk us through how you would create an account and sign in to the application.

* Task 2:
    * Imagine that you are in the mood to look for a new song in a new genre of music that you don’t listen to often. You decide to look for a new song in the classical genre. We would like you to navigate the interface and find a song that you like. After finding a song that you like, you want to add it to a new playlist. So we would like you to again navigate the app, create a new playlist and add the new song that you found.

* Task 3: 
    * Imagine that you are an up and coming music artist that is trying to promote their music across multiple platforms. You want to promote yourself on this platform in order to gain more followers. See if you can navigate the interface and be able to upload your own custom song snippet for others to listen too.

* Ease of Task Ratings:
    * On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is “Very Difficult” and 5 is “Very Easy.” How would you rate your experience in being able to accomplish this task? Why?

* Wrap-up Questions:  
    * Overall, which program did you prefer and why?
    * What made the other program less appealing and why?
    * Were there any features that you preferred over the other when navigating through both applications?
    * Any additional features you would like for it to have?
    * Any thoughts or comments?

# Findings - 
Task 1: All participants were able to create an account and sign-in, letting us know that our sign-up process is simple as well as intuitive.
The ability to already be logged in after creating an account made the experince much more enjoyable for participants. One user voiced that they liked that there was minimal information needed to create an account.

Task 2: All participants were able to find and like a song within the prototype, but participants stuggled with adding it to a playlist. We learned that we need let users add songs to playlists with as little clicks as possible. Participants who used shazam all had the idea to press the menu button with the three vertical dots, which let us know that the same button would be useful in our app.

Task 3: All participants were able to upload their own song to the app. A few of the users struggled to find the "upload" button, so we could make it easier to access. One stated that they saw the visual confirmation which let them know they were done with their task. Average ease rank was 4.2/5.

# Conclusions - 

# Caveats - 
The main limitation of our research was the fidelity of our prototype. Certain features/predictable actions made by the participants wouldn't anything, so they had to assume what would happen.
