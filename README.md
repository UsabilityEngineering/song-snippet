# Song Snippet

Avid music listeners often spend hours trying to find new songs that suit their tastes. Having to listen to each individual song will consume a lot of time that could be spent doing other activities. Our goal is to allow users to discover and like new songs in a timely manner without having to waste hours finding songs to add to their playlist. Our app will allow users to listen to a snippet of the song and give them a general idea of what the song will sound like. The user will then be able to like or dislike the song by swiping left or right; which they then can add to their playlist on their music platform of choice. We want to make discovering music more enjoyable and less of a chore.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Song Snippet’s goal is to give users more accessibility of finding new songs to listen to. In our first phase, we spent our time gathering information to better understand our users and needs, how we compare to our competitors, and where we should be going forward.

To gather our data we performed a Competitive Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation to better understand our competitors and see what we can do to make our product stand out amongst our competitors. 
* A Competitive Analysis that highlights our competitors and compares their services. Using the information here, we can determine how we want to navigate our project going forward.
* A Heuristic Evaluation to find the strengths and weaknesses of our main competitor. From this we can determine what areas we could focus and improve upon. 
* Personas and Scenarios that highlight the average user experience needs.
* Sketches of our initial design and how we want to navigate our project going forward.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

In Phase II, we created wireframes. This gives us the opportunity to visualize where we should place different elements of our ideas without the need to code the product. We also performed cognitive walkthroughs of our wireframes to see how users would interact and see what areas need the most improvement. 
Based on the information that we have gathered in Phase I, we have decided to go with a simplistic design that allows users to achieve their goal with relatively no trouble.

Our wireframes include such features as:
* Landing Homepage that displays the user’s liked songs 
* Page for playlists
* Pages for liking and disliking songs
* Search page for finding new songs to listen to
* Navigation Bar to navigate through the menus
* Account Information page

Upon the results of our cognitive walkthrough that we have performed, the feedback we have received is mixed. 
* Some users were able to achieve their goals, while others were lost trying to navigate the wireframes.
* Using this information, we have decided to focus more on clarity on interaction with some buttons while also applying some visual design along the way. 

With the informal feedback that we have received, we have concluded that our application was simple and straightforward. 
* While still having room for improvement, users did not have many difficulties navigating through the application. 

From what we have learned throughout Phase II, we have decided that we do not need to incorporate that much design toward our user testing in Phase III. Rather we plan to focus more on our interaction with users and make it easier for them to interact with. We will plan to implement design along the way, however it will not be our main focus moving forward.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

In Phase III, we put our prototype to the test. By testing our prototype against users, we were able to gather useful information and see where we stand up against our competition. We gathered 5 participants and had them test our prototype against one of our competitors Shazam. By performing the same tasks on each application we were able to determine the strengths and weaknesses of our prototype, so that we could later improve upon them. 

Our protocol during the test included these tasks:
* An introduction to familiarize users with our prototype
* Background questions in order to gather data
* Various tasks in order to evaluate the user’s experience
    * Create an account and be able to log in 
    * Navigate toward the song discovery page
    * Like a song
    * Navigate to the Library and create a playlist
    * Upload their own custom song snippet
* Ratings on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being difficult and 5 being the easiest for each task
* A conclusion/debrief section to gather more data on their experience and any additional comments

Upon the results of the user test, we gathered much useful feedback and have determined that while our prototype is functional and simple to use. There are still some areas that can be improved upon.
* 80% of users found our prototype more favorable than using Shazam
* Users struggled at first to find the upload button, but eventually found it after looking
* Not all users were able to complete the tasks completely, only managing to get to a certain point and feel like they already accomplished the task.

After discussing our prototype further with the participants, we received some interesting feedback on ways that we could improve our prototype in the future.
* Users wanted to see more ways to discover songs outside of the main functionality 
* Users also wanted a way to compare songs with friends, seeing their likes and dislikes and matching those results with their own

Using the information that we have gathered throughout our user test, we have learned much about how users interact with our prototype and the kind of expectations they have of it. We have come to the conclusion that while users had not as much difficulty navigating through the prototype there are still some areas that need improvement. Going forward our next goal would be to change around some aspects of our prototype and move on to focus more on the design.
