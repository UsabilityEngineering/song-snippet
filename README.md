# Song Snippet

Avid music listeners often spend hours trying to find new songs that suit their tastes. Having to listen to each individual song will consume a lot of time that could be spent doing other activities. Our goal is to allow users to discover and like new songs in a timely manner without having to waste hours finding songs to add to their playlist. Our app will allow users to listen to a snippet of the song and give them a general idea of what the song will sound like. The user will then be able to like or dislike the song by swiping left or right; which they then can add to their playlist on their music platform of choice. We want to make discovering music more enjoyable and less of a chore.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Song Snippetâ€™s goal is to give users more accessibility of finding new songs to listen to. In our first phase, we spent our time gathering information to better understand our users and needs, how we compare to our competitors, and where we should be going forward.

To gather our data we performed a Competitive Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation to better understand our competitors and see what we can do to make our product stand out amongst our competitors. 
* A Competitive Analysis that highlights our competitors and compares their services. Using the information here, we can determine how we want to navigate our project going forward.
* A Heuristic Evaluation to find the strengths and weaknesses of our main competitor. From this we can determine what areas we could focus and improve upon. 
* Personas and Scenarios that highlight the average user experience needs.
* Sketches of our initial design and how we want to navigate our project going forward.
