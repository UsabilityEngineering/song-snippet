# Methods -
To gain insight on our competitors, we have decide to conduct two different research methods in order to organize our thoughts. Our main methods of research were Competitive Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation.

## Competitive Analysis:
| Product | Strengths | Weaknesses | Quality Level | Price/Cost | Platform |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Tiktok | - Large User Base - Access to non popular artists/creators that you wouldnâ€™t hear through other sources | Snippets may not always include music | High: Quality interface with usable technology | None | - Web -Mobile App

Spotify
Large Database of songs

Usability of the main function (recognizing songs) is based on how good the microphone and speaker playing the music is.
