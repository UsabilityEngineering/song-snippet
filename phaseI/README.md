# Methods -
To gain insight on our competitors, we have decide to conduct two different research methods in order to organize our thoughts. Our main methods of research were Competitive Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation.

## Competitive Analysis:
| Product | Strengths | Weaknesses | Quality Level | Price/Cost | Platform |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Tiktok | - Large User Base - Access to non popular artists/creators that you wouldn’t hear through other sources | Snippets may not always include music | High: Quality interface with usable technology | None | - Web -Mobile App |
