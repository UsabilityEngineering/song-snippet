# Methods -
To gain insight on our competitors, we have decide to conduct two different research methods in order to organize our thoughts. Our main methods of research were Competitive Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation.

Demographic:
Our demographic would include any avid music enjoyer. Our demographic is very broad because our product can list such a wide variety of music; that it would be impossible to narrow it down to a specific target audience. Since most people listen to music, this product could be beneficial to almost all of society, especially those who would use it in a social media way.


## Competitive Analysis:
|  Product | Strengths  | Weaknesses  | Quality Level  |  Price/Cost | Platform  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tiktok | Large User Base, Access to non popular artists/creators that you wouldn’t hear through other sources  | Snippets may not always include music  | High: Quality interface with usable technology | None | Web and Mobile App  |
| Spotify  | - Large Database of songs - High definition audio | - No unreleased / underground - Only released by a major label or spotify program | High: Quality songs with licensed music  | Free Version and Paid Membership  | Mobile, Web, Smart Devices, and Game Consoles  |
| Shazam | - Will list similar songs that you have searched on the app - Will let a user play a popular snippet of commonly known songs | Usability of the main function (recognizing songs) is based on how good the microphone and speaker playing the music is | High | None  | Mobile and Web |

## Heuristic Evaluation:
1. Visibility of System Status - 7

The only way to be notified of updates is through the app store, there is no way to check any update notes within the app. However, the update notes that are written do keep the user updated on what has changed. 

2. Match between System and the Real World - 9 

Everything is pretty much easily understandable and straightforward. There is one button for Apple Music/Spotify which is not exactly clear on what it does. 

3. User Control and Freedom - 10

The app allows a fair amount of user control and freedom when navigating through the app. Everything is clearly marked whether it is an x button or cancel. 

4. Consistency and Standards - 10

It falls within all of the consistency and standards of other streaming apps so there should be no trouble trying to learn how to navigate through the app.

5. Error Prevention - 4

There is good communication between errors between the product and the consumer. There would be a pop-up notification that tells the user what the problem is.

6. Recognition rather than recall - 10

The UI of the app is easy to navigate and very simple. It doesn’t have any information that clutters the screen and makes it overwhelming to have to navigate. 

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use - 8

The ease of use is relatively the same for both a novice user and an experienced one. There really is not much difference, the app overall is still really easy to navigate and use. 

8. Aesthetic and minimalist design - 9

The overall design of the app is great, minimalist and straightforward. There is the main function which is the song recognizer and a list of music that is trending. However, you do have to scroll down quite a bit to be able to reach some of the songs that are not visible at first glance and the main interface when opening is to find music by recognition rather than showing music that users have already discovered.

9. Helps users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - 7

The app will help users recognize the problem, however they will often not tell you how to solve the problem and recover from the error.

10. Help and documentation - 8

There is a clearly labeled help button in the support section in the settings. This will link you to a page where there is a whole multi-page manual on how to navigate the app, use certain features, and copyright information.
