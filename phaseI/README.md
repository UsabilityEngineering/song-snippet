# Methods -
To gain insight on our competitors, we have decide to conduct two different research methods in order to organize our thoughts. Our main methods of research were Competitive Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation.

Demographic:
Our demographic would include any avid music enjoyer. Our demographic is very broad because our product can list such a wide variety of music; that it would be impossible to narrow it down to a specific target audience. Since most people listen to music, this product could be beneficial to almost all of society, especially those who would use it in a social media way.


## Competitive Analysis:
|  Product | Strengths  | Weaknesses  | Quality Level  |  Price/Cost | Platform  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tiktok | Large User Base, Access to non popular artists/creators that you wouldnâ€™t hear through other sources  | Snippets may not always include music  | High: Quality interface with usable technology | None | Web and Mobile App  |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |
